Wireless charging is a convenient method of charging Electric Vehicles (EVs). Its 
application
has been widely studied for electric cars but so far there have been limited 
experiments for electric bicycles
(e-bikes). This paper addresses the design process and implementation details related 
to a wireless charger for
a specific e-bike. Some issues such as the position of the secondary coil or the control 
algorithm prove to be
crucial to the performance of the wireless transfer. Concerning the placement of the 
secondary coil, the paper
proposes and validates a theoretical model to quantify the effects of the surrounding 
interfering materials.
A CC-CV (Constant Current - Constant Voltage) control algorithm has been 
implemented to validate the
theoretical results in these two charging phases. The control, the coils and the 
compensation networks have
been designed to be simple and robust. The theoretical model, the charger and its 
control have proven to be
effective in a real 84-W e-bike.
